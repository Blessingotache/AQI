## Air Quality Prediction using AI/ML
Welcome to the Air Quality Prediction project—a comprehensive AI/ML solution to predict air quality levels based on pollutant data. This project is part of my AI/ML specialization with DSFP and leverages machine learning to drive insights into industrial safety, climate change mitigation, and public health improvements.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model for air quality using real-world data. It includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), custom feature engineering to calculate pollutant indexes, and the development of a Random Forest Classifier to predict Air Quality Index ranges.((AQI)-a score that tells you how safe or harmful the air is to breathe). The model is then deployed using Streamlit for interactive, real-time predictions. With a deep interest in data science and its application to environmental issues, I utilized this dataset to build a predictive model that categorizes air quality into Good, Poor, Moderate, Unhealthy, Hazardous or Very unhealthy based on several pollutant levels, including SO₂, NO₂, RSPM, and SPM.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data). It provided comprehensive air quality data that enabled extensive EDA and model training.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and modeling

- Pandas for data manipulation

- Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

- scikit-learn for model development and evaluation

- Streamlit for deploying the model as an interactive web app

- Pickle for saving and loading the trained model
