## Air Quality Prediction using AI/ML
Welcome to the Air Quality Prediction projectâ€”a comprehensive AI/ML solution to predict air quality levels based on pollutant data. This project is part of my AI/ML specialization with DSFP and leverages machine learning to drive insights into industrial safety, climate change mitigation, and public health improvements.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model for air quality using real-world data. It includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), custom feature engineering to calculate pollutant indexes, and the development of a Random Forest Classifier to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) ranges. The model is then deployed using Streamlit for interactive, real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and modeling

- Pandas for data manipulation

- Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

- scikit-learn for model development and evaluation

- Streamlit for deploying the model as an interactive web app

- Pickle for saving and loading the trained model
